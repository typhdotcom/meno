/-! # The Theta Graph: incidence data (topology layer)

The subdivided theta graph `K₂,₃` — two junction vertices joined by
three internal-vertex paths — as **pure incidence data**: edge maps,
the graph, the two integral basis cycles sharing a path, and the raw
topological facts about them (lattice membership, real spanning,
integral spanning, independence of the casts), all stated through the
substrate's `IncidenceGraph.boundary` — no specialized boundary
operator, no basis structure (the lattice basis `thetaLatticeBasis` is assembled from
these facts in `Meno/GraphInstances.lean` via
`IncidenceGraph.basisOfCycles`).

Everything priced lives downstream: the chain Gram `!![4, 2; 2, 4]`,
its positive-definiteness and inverse, and the priced Gram data are
**harmonic** content and live in `Meno/ThetaHarmonic.lean`. -/

/-! ## The subdivided theta graph `K₂,₃`

Vertices: `0 = u`, `1 = v` (junctions), `2, 3, 4` (path interiors).
Edges (all oriented junction-to-junction): `e₀ : u→a₁`, `e₁ : a₁→v`,
`e₂ : u→a₂`, `e₃ : a₂→v`, `e₄ : u→a₃`, `e₅ : a₃→v`. Cycle basis
`c₁ = p₁ − p₃`, `c₂ = p₂ − p₃`. -/

/-- **The cycle space is exactly the span of the basis** (`b₁ = 2`):
a cochain with vanishing boundary is determined by its flows on the
first and second paths, as a combination of `c₁` and `c₂`. Flow
conservation at each interior vertex equalizes the two edges of each
path; conservation at the junction forces the third path's flow to be
minus the sum of the first two. -/
